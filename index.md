# About Me
I’m a PhD candidate in the [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology, and Biophysics (CMDB)](https://cmdb.jhu.edu/) program at Johns Hopkins University, in the lab of [Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org/). I am interested evolutionary biology and population genetics, and my research focuses on the development of methods for alignment-free population genetics. 

Prior to joining the CMDB program, I graduated from The University of Pennsylvania and subsequently worked as a research technician in the labs of [Julien Ayroles](https://ayroleslab.princeton.edu/) and [Alexander Gimelbrant](https://gimelbrantlab.med.harvard.edu/research-0).
