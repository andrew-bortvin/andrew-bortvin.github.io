I enjoy film photography, and am especially fond of working with homebrewed developers as an environmentally conscious, DIY alternative to store-bought solutions. Working out the right mix of ingredients in the darkroom reminds of my days as a bench scientist. I'm particularly happy with the results I've had with Caffenol (Coffee, Vitamin C, Washing Soda, Water). All photos below are shot on 35mm film with a Nikon FM2 and developed in Folger's Breakfast Blend.
