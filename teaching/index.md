* Teaching Assistant, **Developmental Genetics Lab**, Fall 2021, Spring 2022
	
	The Developmental Genetics Lab prepares undergraduate students to conduct independent research through participation in a semester-longer research project. Students learn experimental methods by using CRISPR-Cas9 to edit the *C. elegans* genome. Students also learn about the application of programming to biology research by developing a Python program that identifies CRISPR editing target sites and generates crRNA and repair template sequences. As a TA, I taught students experimental techniques, led lectures teaching Python programming, and was responsible for proctoring and grading.
