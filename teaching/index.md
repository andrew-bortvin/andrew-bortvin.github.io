I am a teaching assistant for the CMDB program's one-week **[Quantitative Biology Bootcamp](http://bxlab.github.io/cmdb-bootcamp/)** and am a tutor for its **[Quantitative Biology Lab](http://bxlab.github.io/cmdb-lab/)**. This sequence of courses is taken by all first-year students in the program, most of whom have no coding experience. Students learn Python and bash programming by performing analysis of published biological data, and implement methods such as sequence alignment, bulk and single-cell RNA-seq analysis, and GWAS. As a TA, I led group live coding sessions, worked with students individually to debug code, and developed course materials to convert a traditionally in-person course to a hybrid format for teaching during the pandemic.  
	
In the 2021-2022 academic year, I was a Teaching Assistant for the undergraduate-level **Developmental Genetics Lab**. This course prepares undergraduate students to conduct independent research through participation in a semester-long project that combines computational and experimental methods. Student develop algorithms to parse genomic sequence data and identify potential CRISPR editing targets. Then, they use identified sequences to generate a CRISPR edited *C. elegans* strain. As a TA, I taught students fundamental molecular biology wet lab techniques and led lectures teaching Python programming.

In the summer of 2022, I have participated in teaching institute training through the [Teaching Academy](https://ctei.jhu.edu/teaching-academy).
